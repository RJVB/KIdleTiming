/**
 * This is a modernised Macintosh backend (plugin) implementation for KIdleTime.
 * It uses a Cocoa event filter to detect global and application user input events
 * (which indicate absence/end of idling) and the HIDIdleTime property from IOKit
 * to obtain the time since the last event.
 * 
 * Custom timeouts ("the system has not had input events for X milliseconds") are
 * detected via a polling algorithm that uses an adaptive polling interval in the
 * default configuration that limits its overhead as much as possible while maintaining
 * good detection accuracy. The class does provide a mechanism to switch it to a
 * fixed-frequency polling strategy of configurable resolution, but that mechanism
 * isn't yet accessible via the KIdleTime class.
 * 
 * @note polling comes at a cost. This cost is minimised with the default, adaptive interval
 * configuration, but applications should not let the KIdleTime instance active when it 
 * is not needed. This OS X backend allows to deactivate KIdleTime by removing all timeouts;
 * @see KIdleTime::removeAllIdleTimeouts.
